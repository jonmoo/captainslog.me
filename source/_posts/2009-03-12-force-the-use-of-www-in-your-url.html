This is a pretty simple use of <code>mod_rewrite</code> to force the use www in your urls.
<blockquote>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.example\.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule .? http://www.example.com%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]\</blockquote>
The first line is only needed if mod_rewrite isn't enabled on your server (though the module does need to be enabled).  Replace example.com with your actual domain name of course.
