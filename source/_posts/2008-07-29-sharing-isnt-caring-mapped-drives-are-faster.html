According to <a href="http://www.seabreezecomputers.com/tips/filexfer.htm" target="_blank">this</a> a mapped Windows drive is a lot faster for transferring files than simply browsing to the share. Find your share under Network Places, right-click and select "Map Network Drive".

Some other tips: put a $ at the end of your share name to hide it. Upgrade to SP3 to have multiple shares with different permissions on a folder.
