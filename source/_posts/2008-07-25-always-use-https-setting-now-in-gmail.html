Google added a "always use HTTPS" setting to Gmail recently.  Very nice addition.  No more adding <em>https://</em> myself and even more importantly, no more forgetting to add it.

I'd recommend that anyone using Gmail enable this option.  While email is <strong>plain text over the public Ineternet</strong> and shouldn't even remotly be treated as secure communications, it's still nice to have your credentials private.
