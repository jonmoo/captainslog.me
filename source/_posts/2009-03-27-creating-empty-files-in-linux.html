I had a need for several files of various sizes to do some network testing with.Â  I found a very good us for <code>dd</code> here.

<code>dd if=/dev/zero of=10mb-file.bin bs=1024k count=n</code>

Using the above command (and replacing n for a value) allows the creation of empty files with the size specificed.  Need a 10Mb file, n = 10.  Need a 100Mb file... n = 100.  You get the idea.
