I have had my Mikrotik RB751G-2HnD in service for a few months now, and it's been rocking along great.  The cheap price had me a bit skeptical at first, but after seeing some of the reviews and the community around their devices, I was pretty sold.  I purchased the first one to replace a Linksys E4500 wireless router after the Cisco cloud connect upgrade.

I am using the device as a simple home gateway router for my network, with many of the more advanced features disabled.  I do have IPv6 enabled, using a tunnel provided by Hurricane Electric using their tunnel broker service, which has been very stable.  The wireless works great with coverage area expanding beyond what the Linksys provided.

The device supports various VPN connections, but I have yet to test any of this.  Other notable features include a wireless hotspot manager, VLANs and several routing protocols including BGP.
