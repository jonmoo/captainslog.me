A project involving asterisk has forced me to find a way to help manage my configurations.  I'm going to give using subversion a go at helping me to keep some level of change control and really simple backups, and I'm going to share my thoughts on that here.  This post doesn't have any new details, it's simply a way for me to remember to update :-)

Stay tuned.
