Found this today.  Probably older news for most of us, but I'm a bit behind on some of the graphical appliactions for Gnome.  It's a twitter client for the Gnome desktop envirmont.  Oddly enough, it's named gtwitter.  Info can be found at the project site <a title="gtwitter" href="http://code.google.com/p/gtwitter/" target="_self">here</a>.

I've been using it for about two days now, and things seem stable enough.  There are several options you can configure relating to the feeds to follow, interface details and the like.

I'd suggest trying it out for anyone using Gnome and twitter and looking for a nice client.  If you have any other clients for twitter, let us know in the comments.
