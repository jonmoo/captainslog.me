The description from asterisk for this is <code>GotoIf(condition?[labeliftrue]:[labeliffalse])</code>, however for me (being somewhat new to asterisk, and not fully understanding all the little bits, this was a bit confusing. A better way of describing this, at least for those of use new to asterisk, might be <code>GotoIf(condition?[context,priority,labeliftrue]:[context,priority,labeliffalse])</code>.
I have not used labels in the dial plan before, and when starting out with this application I read label to be a context.  This lead me to write my dial plan similar to this..
<pre>[default]
exten =&gt; 100,1,GoToIf(condition?true,false)
[true]
exten =&gt; s,1,...
[false]
exten =&gt; s,1,...
</pre>
In retrospect, it's obvious what the documentation is saying, but as I said, not being familiar with labels, I was a bit lost.
