Mine didn't :(

Luckily Google helped me find a solutation rather quickly, and using information from <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/177321">this site</a> I was able to get things working again.

Basically, I added <code>xkeymap.nokeycodeMap = true </code> to <code>/etc/vmware/config</code> and things started working right.  Another on the forum suggested remapping the keys, but I didn't try that.
