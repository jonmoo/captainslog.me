I needed to remove a physical volume from a LVM volume group, and found this is done using the pvmove command.  However, trying to run this, resulted in an immediate, and suprising error
<pre># pvmove /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
Required device-mapper target(s) not detected in your kernel</pre>
After some quick google'ing I found on this <a href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2005-05/2660.html">list</a> a cause, and a fix.  Appreantly, pvmove uses something provided by the raid1 module to do it's magic.  So, loading loading the dm-mirror kernel module fixes the issue and pvmove works as expected.  Thanks debian-user list :-)
