I was going to post today on why I think email has losts it's appeal in the last few years.  Instead, I'm going to share a very good series of posts with from another blog I've been reading lately online...

There is a nice <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/13/inbox-zero">series</a> over at <a href="http://www.43folders.com">43folders</a> on managing your inbox.  The series goes into how to take your inbox from "overstuffed to zero".  Very nice read for anyone dealing with an overcrowed inbox.

I'll post my thoughts on why you shouldn't use email later..
