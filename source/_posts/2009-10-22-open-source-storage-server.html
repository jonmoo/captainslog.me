This is not going to be a full review, but more a general take on things.

Since moving from VMware Server to ESXi to host my virtual machines, I've been very interested in looking into some more of the advanced features of ESX and ESXi yet most of these require iSCSI.  I remember from a few years back using <a href="http://openfiler.com/">Openfiler</a> to do some simple samba file sharing, and remembered it supported iSCSI as one method of giving out storage.

Now, I've yet to use any of the features of ESX that require iSCSI, or even setup <a href="http://openfiler.com/">Openfiler</a> to export storage via iSCSI, but I have been using it for simple file sharing and must say I'm quite impressed.

Setup is a breeze, taking about 20 minutes on an older PC. Management is done almost entirely through a <a href="http://openfiler.com/products/screenshots/">web interface</a>, that is very easy to use.  Unlink many of the other appliance packages out there, the web interface is very simple and straight forward.  Very much impressed with that.

Over the next few months I'll be exploring <a href="http://openfiler.com/">Openfiler</a> much more, and hopefully getting into some of it's more advanced features including interface bonding, md devices and clustering.  I plan to keep updating as things more along.
