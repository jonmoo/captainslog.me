For Windows DropBox users. Here is a simple way to share list of links for your Public folder. This script doesn't show files in sub-directories.

1. Create a makefilelist.bat file with script to list all files in directory.
2. Use Scheduled Tasks to run the .bat file Daily or Weekly, etc as needed; depending on how often you update files in DropBox Public.
3. Share the list file with "Copy Public Link".
4. Open Public Link in a browser. You know have a list of all public files that is up-to-date.

You can see an example and download the makefilelist.bat file here:
