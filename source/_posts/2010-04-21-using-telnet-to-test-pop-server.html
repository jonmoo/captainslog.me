First, using telnet and open a connection the remote POP server
<pre>telnet mailserver 110</pre>
Where <code>mailserver</code> is the mail server you want to connect to.  Note that port <code>110</code> is the default port for POP, but could be different depending on your servers settings.

Once connected, use <code>USER</code> and <code>PASS</code> to login.

<pre>
