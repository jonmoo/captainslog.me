When using email, you should always keep the following <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rules</span> suggestions in mind.  Most of these apply to mailing lists, but could just as easily make any email communication (and maybe even instant messaging) better.

First, don't top post.  Not only is top posting counter-productive it is annoying.  Also, if the person before you sucks at life, don't follow with it.  Remove everything but the relevant parts, and post under that.  It makes life better for everyone.

Along with the last one, don't include unnecessary posts in your reply.  More than likely, most people will choose not to follow the first suggestion, so lets alteast remove the parts of the message that are unneeded.  If you're reply to a long message, break it apart.  Put your replies inline, so others can better read them..

Keep the signature short.  If you feel you must include a 12 line signature complete with pictures, color and blink tags, only do so once.  A simple sig is great.  A simple sig 24 times is annoying.  Don't do it.  Any mailer worth using allows you to configure when to add a sig, so don't add one on replies.

Stay on topic.  If the current thread has sparked a new topic, start it elsewhere.  Threads and topics enjoy having an exclusive relationship, so keep it that way.  If you're changing the thread, atleast warn people (<em>New Thread Topic (WAS: old thread)</em>).

That's all for now.  (actually, that's just the 4 things that annoyed me while checking my mail tonight)  I'll expand as more annoying things come to light.
