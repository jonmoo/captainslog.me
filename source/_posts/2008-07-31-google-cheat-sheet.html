From the Google Help site: "<em>Here's a quick list of some of our most popular tools to help refine and improve your   search." </em>Doesn't provide any new information, but it's a nice refresher one basic search operators.

You can find the site <a href="http://www.google.com/help/cheatsheet.html">here</a>, and the rest of Googles help is <a href="http://www.google.com/support/">here</a>.
