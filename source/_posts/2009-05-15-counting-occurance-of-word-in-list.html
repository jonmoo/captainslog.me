I've had a need to count the number of times a certain value (in this case, a word) appears in a list when using OpenOffice.org.

Here was my problem.  I had a long list of values, each had a status of either "good", "bad", or "incomplete".  I wanted to count the number of times each of the follow occurred.  It turned out to be pretty easy.

Create the following formula where you want the count to be.<code>COUNTIF(range,expression)</code> and bobs your uncle.
