This is going to (hopefully) be part of a much larger article on moving web sites from one host to another.  Until then, I leave with just a simple command to download almost all of an entire webpage to a local directory...

&lt;code&gt;wget -rnp -nd www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;

Or, if we want to download the same files, but store them in a directory created for each host...

&lt;code&gt;wget -rnp www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;

Well, that's all for now.  As this project moves forward for me, you should see more.
