Paul Frields from Fedora posted an message to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-announce-list">fedora-announce-list</a> regarding a compermise of some of the Fedora systems.  If you use Fedora, it's worth reading over and following up with.  I'm not personally a Fedora user, so I can't provide and user commentary on this issue.

Read the orgional post <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-August/msg00012.html">here</a>.  You can probably followup with this thread, and others from the fedora-announce-list <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/">archives</a>
