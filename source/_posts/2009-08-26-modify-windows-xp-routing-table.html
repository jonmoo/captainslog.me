During some network changes I've found the need to modify the routing table.

To change the default route on Windows XP (and possibly Windows Vista, 2000, etc) you use the route command.  The syntax is pretty simple, here is a quick example....
<pre>
route change 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 172.18.12.120
</pre>
To delete or add routes, simply change the keyword change to either add or delete.
<pre>
route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 10.10.0.50
</pre>
