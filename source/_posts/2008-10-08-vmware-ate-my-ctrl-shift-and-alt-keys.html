Working with VMware on Ubuntu 8.04 has proved to be much more trouble then in the past.  It appears, that when using VMware with a Windows guest, the CTRL, ALT and Shift keys no longer work.  It gets better though..

Google Search has offered a few solutions, mostly related to resetting keyboard layouts and such.  However, when I try and use any other key, take the 's' for example, Ubuntu closes the current active window, and opens the file manager.

So far, the only working solution I've found involves two steps.  First, restart the computer then cease using VMware to run Windows guests.

Easy enough, I suppose..

If anyone out there has a fix for this, or knows something I'm missing, please leave details in the comments.
