I recently started using FreeNAS again after exploring other options that existed, such as openfiler, and now that I've returned, ZFS seems to be the cool thing to do.  After reading, watching videos and playing with ZFS I'm sold on all the features it offers.  However, I must ask, is there a compelling reason to use ZFS over UFS for a single disk?  I'd really like to see some comments on this.
