If you've just installed Thunderbird on Fedora 13, you've probably noticed the Global Search bar is missing.  At least, this is one of the first things I noticed. After using Thunderbird 3.x for sometime on Windows I've really come to love this feature.

It seems the default configuration on Fedora doesn't enable this feature by default, however it is simple to get working.  Go to the Preferences menu, Advanced section and check "Enable Global Search and Indexer".  After this, restart Thunderbird and it will begin indexing your mail.  After which, the Global Search should work as expected.
