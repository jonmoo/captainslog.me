The <a title="Vim" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> text editor may be one of the best text editors out there, but it does have a learning curve to it.  However with patient, practice and a bit of luck you can master Vim in less time than it takes to install some other text editors (ok, maybe that's a stretch, but I'm sure you get the idea).  The best way to learn is by doing, so why not take this approach with Vim.  An easy way is with vimtutor.  If you alreay have Vim installed, it's probably just as easy as typeing vimtutor on the command line.  If you don't have Vim installed, install the full Vim package using your systems package management system, and then run vimtutor.

Upon running vimtutor you're presented with a short introduction to what's going to be happening then a series of lessons to teach you how to use Vim.  I'd recommend not skipping any section even if you feel you already know the material.  It's a great way to refresh yourself on some of the simplier areas of Vim as well as teach you some mof the more advanced features.
