If you're going to be using Asterisk with a PRI card, there are some important steps you have to follow in the right order.

Normally, I install the zaptel package then install Asterisk.  This is all great, until I need PRI support.  For that, I must also install the libpri package.

Important to note, for asterisk to get PRI support you must install libpri BEFORE any other package.
