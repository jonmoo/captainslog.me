Be careful when using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" search on Google. You do not get to see the result's discription or what webpage you are about to visit and it could cause you some trouble. For example currently "zune windows theme" visits the download URL. So instead of a webpage you are instantly prompted to download a file.
